## CUSEC 2018
I gave a talk at [CUSEC 2018](http:/2018.cusec.net){:target="_blank"} called 
"Mistakes I made as a junior software engineer (so you don't have to!)"

*Description: Learn from my mistakes! Most junior software engineers make the 
same few mistakes their first year on the job, and I was certainly no exception. 
Cringe along with me as I relive the embarrassing details of actual blunders I made, 
what I learned from them, and how you can hopefully avoid them in your own career!*
