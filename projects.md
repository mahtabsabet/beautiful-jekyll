## Pikit
Pikit is a game for those who lack fine motor control or who have limited mobility. It uses a single switch as input. 
Pikit can help players learn how to use a single switch to choose menu options. This is a game that my teammates and I 
built at the Gift the Code hackathon in 2016.

## Farm Clicker
Farm Clicker is an incremental game, inspired by [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/)
I built it as an excuse to learn AngularJS.

## GameUp
GameUp was a platform for online ticketing and event promotion for board 
and card games. My teammates and I built it as part of an entrepreneurship 
course at the University of Toronto. 

Unfortunately, since Parse was acquired 
by Facebook and shut down in 2016, the live demo of this site no longer works. RIP GameUp.
