title: Why are Software Engineers so bad at estimating?
subtitle: Like, really bad.

Right now I'm preparing for a talk I'm going to be giving at [CUSEC 2018](http://2018.cusec.net/) 
and one of the things I'm researching is how bad we are at estimating, as an industry.

Turns out, the answer is we are all universally pretty terrible at estimating.

In my first few years working as a developer I just assumed I was so bad at it 
because I was young, inexperienced, naive, etc. But apparently I'm not alone!

According to a paper by Jørgensen and Moløkken-Østvold, "the average effort overrun of software
projects seems to be in the range 30 to 40 percent". 

The [full paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1377193/) is behind a paywall,
but I thought it would be interesting to break down some of their findings.

So here we go, the main reasons why we are collectively so bad at estimation:
