title: Advice for beginner developers

I've had countless people tell me how lucky I am to be in a field like software 
development, where there is a huge demand for good people, and still low supply.

People are figuring out that software is a field they want to be in. I've seen lots 
of my friends decide they want to learn how to program in order to get better 
job prospects, only to give up on it a few weeks later. What's going on here?

Here is the advice I give to people who are considering learning to code, either 
for a career change, or just for fun:

1. Build a project
Some people think that programming languages are cool and fun to learn. Most people 
do not. Odds are, you fall into the latter camp. And if you go to some website 
where you can learn programming languages for free, you'll get sick of it pretty
quickly. 

So don't think "Hey, I've heard that Python is pretty cool. I'll learn python!"
Instead, think "I'd like to build this cool {website/game/deathray}" - and then figure out
what tools you will need to build that! It's way more efficient and motivating that way.
Obviously, if you're a beginner, start small. For example, you could say "I want to build a personal website from scratch."
Then, the tools you'd need to learn would be HTML, CSS, and maybe a bit of JavaScript.
That way, you think of cool things you want to do, and then learn the things that
will help you build that thing.

2. Focus on immediate results rather than long-term goals
In the previous point I said you should pick a small project to start. There is 
[research](http://michellesegar.com/organizations/) to support the fact that people
tend to be better motivated by immediate results, rather than long-term goals. If you pick a project
that is too big and complex while you're still learning, you'll hit lots of roadblocks 
early on, you won't feel like you're accomplishing your goals, and you'll get demotivated and quit.

So, keep the projects small and simple at first!

3. Push through the difficult times
Programming is hard. Seriously. There is so much to learn, and even people who have 
been in the field for years and years are still learning new things every day.

You will face lots of challenges that will make you want to bash your head against 
a wall. Recognize that this happens to everyone, and do your best to push through it.
I often remark that the most important thing I learned from my Computer Engineering degree 
had nothing to do with the content of the courses - I learned that if I push myself really 
hard, and don't let myself get demotivated by problems that seem too difficult, that I 
can solve problems that seemed almost impossible when I started.

Remember: Imposter syndrome is real. We all experience it.

4. Write down what you learned
At some point during these challenging times, you'll have a breakthrough and suddenly understand 
something you didn't before. Write down your learning! It's a really valuable 
exercise that will help solidify the knowledge, and you can come back to it
later and see that a) you worked through a difficult challenge and persevered, and 
b) you may need to actually reference the solution later if you have forgotten 
how to solve it.

5. If you think you may want a career in software, build a portfolio
Having a portfolio of all the cool projects you have built looks 
super impressive to potential employers. It shows that you have experience with a
range of technologies, and that you have an interest in the field. Plus, if you have written 
down what you learned, you can share that with interviewers and impress them even more!
